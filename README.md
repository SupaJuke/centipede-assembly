# Centipede Assembly

A final project written in MIPS assembly as a part of the course CSC258 (Winter 2020).

To run the game,

1) Download the Mars simulator jar file and open it. Read https://courses.missouristate.edu/kenvollmar/mars/index.htm for more.

2) Open centipede.s in the simulator

3) Click on Tools and select "Bitmap Display." Then, click "Connect to MIPS." This will allow you to connect to the game, but do note that you do not have a way to controll your character yet. <br /> <br />
Click on Tools again and select "Keyboard and Display MMIO Simulator" to launch your keyboard. Connect the keyboard the same way you connect the display.
Now you have both the display and keyboards ready!

4) Compile the program and run it. Move your character to left and right by pressing "j" and "k" respectively. Shoot the centipede, fleas, and mushrooms by pressing "x." You can restart the game by pressing "s." Note that you must have your input in the keyboard input otherwise your inputs won't be detected.

Now you're ready to play!
